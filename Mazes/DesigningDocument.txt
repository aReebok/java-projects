1. write step-by-step English for your load method 
that shows the overall structure and where you'll be 
checking for these edge cases
  edge case: The load method should return false if 
  there are any squares that don't have
  *, 7, _, or | as a descriptor, or the number of 
  squares and their organization is 
  inconsistent with the number of rows and columns 
  specified at the beginning of the file
  
  more detailed step-by-step checking:
  1. make sure the given file exists in the
   curernt directory
  2. make sure that the first 3 input lines from file
  have only 2 integers per line.
  3. make sure that only integers are passed in for
  the first three lines of the file: send a error
  message if not and close program.
  4. make sure that length of input ln4 and on is 
  equal to number of columns and are only the using
  the following descriptiors: *, 7, _, |.
  5. also make sure that the number of lines in file
  after line 3 should be equal to the number of rows
  in the maze: if too little lines, return false, end
  program (send err line), if bigger than the number
  of row, then ignore the lines that are past the 
  number of rows: and print out a warning (just 
  ignores the lines that are extra and still prints
  the maze and maze solution correctly).
